# Duara Internship Code Challenge - 22nd May 2018
## Due: 23rd 9:00am May or Earlier


##### There are four tasks in this challenge, choose any of the four.

##### You can use any programming language and any tools from the standard library of your language of choice. The submission instructions are specified at the bottom of the challenge page.

## Task 1
### License Plates:
A license plate number has form ABC-123, three letters followed by three digits. You are to store the set of license plate numbers, assume you will have about a hundred thousand of them, and be able to answer queries like:
* Is license plate PLB-123 a member of the set?
* How many license plates begin with the letters PLB?
* What is the list of license plates that begin with the letters PLB?

###### Your task is to write programs to store and query a list of license plate numbers.

## Task 2
### Division by repeated subtraction:

###### Write a function that divides two numbers and returns their quotient. Use recursive subtraction to find the quotient. The function should only take two arguments.
 
## Task 3
### Distinct Characters:
Write a program to determine if all the characters in a string are distinct. For instance, the word “Programming” has two m and two g, so all the characters are not distinct, but the word “Talking” has seven distinct characters.

###### Your task is to write a program to determine if all the characters in a string are distinct; you should provide three solutions, one that takes time O(n²), one that takes time O(n log n), and one that takes time O(n).

## Task 4
### T9:
The digits on a telephone keypad are associated with letters; for instance, the digit 2 is associated with the letters A, B and C, and the digit 7 is associated with the letters P, Q, R and S. Thus, a word can be converted to its numeric equivalent; for instance, AFRICA can be converted to the number 237422. The conversion is not necessarily unique, so ACT, BAT and CAT all convert to 228.

###### Your task is to write a program that takes a number, such as 228, and returns a list of all the words in a dictionary that are represented by that number. Assume that the dictionary is provided as a file with a list of valid words.


##### How to submit
